**INTRODUCTION**

The College Parking Management System is developed to address the growing challenges of parking space allocation, staff updates, and fine management in academic institutions. Parking management is often a source of frustration due to limited spaces, unregulated allocation, and manual oversight, which can lead to disorganization and inefficiency. Common issues such as unauthorized vehicles, double occupancy of parking spots, and unresolved parking violations create further complications. Traditional methods of managing parking spaces often rely on manual logs or outdated systems, making the process prone to human error and difficult to monitor on a large scale.

This system aims to resolve these challenges by providing an online platform where parking managers can oversee and manage parking operations in real-time. One of its core features is the allocation of fixed parking spaces for staff members, ensuring that parking spots are reserved specifically for authorized personnel. Additionally, it streamlines the process of registering and deregistering staff vehicles, making parking space management much more organized. 

Another key functionality is the ability to impose and manage fines for parking violations. The system offers a user-friendly interface for manual fine entry, allowing parking authorities to log fines based on student roll numbers and maintain a detailed record of violations. Furthermore, the automated violation checker introduces a higher level of enforcement by continuously monitoring parking areas for rule violations, such as unauthorized vehicle entries or prolonged parking in restricted zones, thereby automating part of the enforcement process.

The College Parking Management System ultimately enhances the efficiency of parking operations while fostering transparency and accountability. By digitizing the process and providing a centralized management platform, the system not only reduces the workload on parking staff but also ensures that rules are enforced consistently, and resources are used optimally. This modern approach significantly reduces human error, promotes fair parking practices, and offers a seamless experience for both parking managers and users.
